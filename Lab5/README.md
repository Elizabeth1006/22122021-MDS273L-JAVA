QUESTION:

You are supposed to create a menu-driven program that can encrypt or decrypt a message that the user wishes to transfer.
Your program should have two functions, one for encryption and another for decryption. Each function will accept a string message and return the encrypted or decrypted message.

PROGRAM:
First in the while loop we are asking the user for choice 1 to encrypt ,2 to descrypt and 3 to exit.
In if,else if we select the choice.If we select 1 the message to encrpted is asked and after it is gone to the encrypt function.
The message is then converted into lower case and the str1 and str2 too. 
For each letter in the str1 letter in the str2 is printed.
The same happens for descrypt  that is choice 2 .
If choice 3 is selected the program exits.
